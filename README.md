PROJECT REPORT
Hotel Booking Management System (Python)
—————————————-

1.  INTRODUCTION
    This project is a simple hotel booking management system developed
    in Python.
    It allows users to calculate room charges, apply GST, and maintain
    guest records.

2.  OBJECTIVE
    The main objectives of this project are:

-   To automate hotel room booking calculations
-   To maintain accurate guest records
-   To apply GST correctly
-   To make user interaction simple and efficient

3.  TECHNOLOGIES USED

-   Python (Core Programming)
-   Dictionaries for storing guest data
-   Conditional statements
-   Loops for multiple entries

4.  SYSTEM FEATURES

A. Room Selection Module
The system provides 4 types of rooms, each with fixed pricing.
The user selects a room and enters the number of days, after which the
program calculates:
- Base amount
- GST at 20%
- Final payable amount

B. Guest Information Module
The program collects detailed guest information including:
- Name
- Nationality
- Address
- Check-in and check-out details
- Room number
- Phone number
- Aadhar number (if Indian)

C. Record Storage
Guest entries are stored inside a Python dictionary using the room
number as the key.

D. Multi-entry Support
The program allows storing details of multiple guests using a loop.

5.  WORKING PROCESS
    Step-by-step workflow:

6.  User selects room type

7.  User enters number of stay days

8.  System calculates cost and GST

9.  Guest details are entered

10. Record is stored

11. User decides whether to add more guests

12. Final list of all guests is displayed

13. ADVANTAGES

-   Easy to use
-   Accurate billing with GST
-   Maintains structured guest data
-   Beginner-friendly Python logic

7.  CONCLUSION
    This project demonstrates basic Python programming skills and
    logic-based computation.
    It is suitable for beginners and can be expanded into a full hotel
    management software in the future.
